# FT_TRANSCENDENCE

## Description
Ft_transcendence is the final project of 42's common core curriculum, where you need to create a single-page web application that allows users to play Pong in real-time, chat, and more. This project reinforces your skills in full-stack web development, authentication, websockets, and real-time state management.

## Collaboration
This project involved collaboration with my teammates:
- [eyJvcy](https://github.com/eyJvcy)  
- [BenjaminBerkrouber](https://github.com/BenjaminBerkrouber)  
- [Ezuker](https://github.com/Ezuker)  
- [Ehlzz](https://github.com/Ehlzz)

### This repository contains the first attempt of the ft_transcendence project (*for more information, please refer to the subject in the Git repository*), which was ultimately not completed by the initial team. The project has since been fully rebooted with a new team and a fresh codebase: [ft_transcendence_42](https://github.com/fZpHr/ft_transcendence_42)
